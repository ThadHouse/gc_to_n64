# Gamecube controller to N64 adapter firmware

## Project summary

A common problem with the N64 controllers is the joystick. It wears down and
become unusable. Gamecube controllers do not have this problem and are a good
alternative but an adapter is required.

I have been asked many times if I could design an adapter for using Gamecube
controllers on N64 systems, and this project is the result.

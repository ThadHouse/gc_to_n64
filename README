-= Relase history =-

July 31, 2012 : Version 1.2.1 - Quick bug fix
    - Reset the read failure counter on success. Otherwise the failures
	  accumulate and eventually forces a recalibration, potentially in-game.

July 30, 2012 : Version 1.2 - Bug fixes and maintenance

	- Auto-calibration is now done each time a new controller
	  is connected, which means controllers can be swapped at runtime.
	- The above makes the Wavebird work properly again (was broken in v1.1!)
	- At powerup, the adapter waits for a Gamecube controller.
	- A newer version of the Gamecube communication code (ported from my
	  N64/Gamecube to USB project) is now in place.

January 25, 2011 : Version 1.1. Compatiblity fixes:

    - Auto-calibration of the gamecube joystick at powerup fixes
	  compatiblity issues with controllers that are not *perfectly*
	  centered.

	- Better conversion from Gamecube axis values to N64 values. This
	  fixes issues with some game/controllers where, for instance, 
	  the character would not run at full speed.

	Note: The maximum axis values and corner angles closely approximates
    those from a N64 Hori mini pad.

August 10, 2011 : Version 1.0. Initial relase.


-= Project summary =-

A common problem with the N64 controllers is the joystick. It wears down and 
become unusable. However Gamecube controllers don't seem to wear down much 
and are quite similar to the N64 controllers.

So I've been asked many times if I could design an adapter for using Gamecube 
controllers on a N64 system. This project is the result.

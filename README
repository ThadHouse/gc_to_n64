-= Relase history =-

May 5, 2013 : Version 1.4
    - Tighter timing in the N64 interrupt handler. The adapter now
	  starts answering withing 7.7us. This appears to fix F-Zero X.

April 27, 2013 : Version 1.3.2
    - Fix an ED64 menu "freeze" bug

April 27, 2013 : Version 1.3.1
    - Fixed a bug when mapping the main joystick to buttons. 
	  The up[18]/down[19] and left[20]/right[21] directions were inverted.
    - Fixed a bug when entering a new mapping code where the unchanged
 	  parts of the previously active mapping remained in effect.

March 2, 2013 : Version 1.3 
    - Added a joystick deadzone feature (default OFF). To enable, 
	or disable if previously enabled, hold START until your hear the 5 
	beeps, fully press and release R, the press Z. Wait a few moments 
	for the final beeps. The setting is stored in the adapter, no need
	 to repeat after each power up. 

February 12, 2013 : Version 1.2.2 - Bug fixes and minor features
    - The analog L and R sliders are now unmapped by default.
    - Beep on read errors (when disconnecting controller).
    - Beep once at powerup.

July 31, 2012 : Version 1.2.1 - Quick bug fix
    - Reset the read failure counter on success. Otherwise the failures
	  accumulate and eventually forces a recalibration, potentially in-game.

July 30, 2012 : Version 1.2 - Bug fixes and maintenance

	- Auto-calibration is now done each time a new controller
	  is connected, which means controllers can be swapped at runtime.
	- The above makes the Wavebird work properly again (was broken in v1.1!)
	- At powerup, the adapter waits for a Gamecube controller.
	- A newer version of the Gamecube communication code (ported from my
	  N64/Gamecube to USB project) is now in place.

January 25, 2011 : Version 1.1. Compatiblity fixes:

    - Auto-calibration of the gamecube joystick at powerup fixes
	  compatiblity issues with controllers that are not *perfectly*
	  centered.

	- Better conversion from Gamecube axis values to N64 values. This
	  fixes issues with some game/controllers where, for instance, 
	  the character would not run at full speed.

	Note: The maximum axis values and corner angles closely approximates
    those from a N64 Hori mini pad.

August 10, 2011 : Version 1.0. Initial relase.


-= Project summary =-

A common problem with the N64 controllers is the joystick. It wears down and 
become unusable. However Gamecube controllers don't seem to wear down much 
and are quite similar to the N64 controllers.

So I've been asked many times if I could design an adapter for using Gamecube 
controllers on a N64 system. This project is the result.

-= Relase history =-
* January 25, 2011 : Version 1.1. Compatiblity fixes:

    - Auto-calibration of the gamecube joystick at powerup fixes
	  compatiblity issues with controllers that are not *perfectly*
	  centered.

	- Better conversion from Gamecube axis values to N64 values. This
	  fixes issues with some game/controllers where, for instance, 
	  the character would not run at full speed.

	Note: The maximum axis values and corner angles closely approximates
    those from a N64 Hori mini pad.


* August 10, 2011 : Version 1.0. Initial relase.


-= Project summary =-

A common problem with the N64 controllers is the joystick. It wears down and 
become unusable. However Gamecube controllers don't seem to wear down much 
and are quite similar to the N64 controllers.

So I've been asked many times if I could design an adapter for using Gamecube 
controllers on a N64 system. This project is the result.
